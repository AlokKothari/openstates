A Solr QueryResponseWriter that outputs results in the Open State Project JSON response format.

To build:

  lein deps
  lein jar

Due to some annoyances around clojure and Solr's custom class loader the easiest way to use this is to copy the openstates-solr-writer.jar and everything in lib/ directly into Solr's WEB-INF/lib/ directory.
